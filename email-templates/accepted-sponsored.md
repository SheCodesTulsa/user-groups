Dear { usergroup_name },

We are pleased to inform you that the Techlahoma Board approved { usergroup_name } for 2019.

Your group is important to the Oklahoma tech community, and Techlahoma is excited to sponsor your group! Please note that we use [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) for events. Meetup allows us to carefully track the number of Oklahomans each of the groups reaches, which in turn helps us know where to focus our efforts.

### Meetup

As we mentioned before, Meetup is very important for our process. Without Meetup, we wouldn't be able to provide the services we provide including scheduling. Please be sure to schedule your meetings at least 7 days in advance each time.

*Please note that if your meeting is not scheduled on Meetup at least 7 days in advance, **you will not be able to meet at Starspace46.***

{ if approved for SS46 }

### Starspace46

If your group plans to meet at Starspace46:

- At least two co-organizers must sign and return the Starspace46 User Group Leader agreement to Ava **by 2/1.**
  You may sign the agreement and send Ava a picture of the signed agreement in Slack or give it to her directly when you are at StarSpace.

- Meetups must be scheduled at least one week in advance  
  Starspace requires at least 7 days notice in order to use the event space. If your meetup is not scheduled at least one week in advance, Starspace46 will not be available.

*Please note that this agreement needs to signed again each year.*

{ if approved for 36N }

### 36 Degrees North

Additionally, we are pleased to offer space for your group to meet at [36Â°N](https://www.36degreesnorth.co/contact/). Please contact Luke Crouch (@groovecoder in Slack) for more infromation.

{ if approved for food/drink reimbursement }

### Food and Drink Reimbursement

We know it's easier to keeping providing content for your group when you don't have to worry about food and drinks, so we've allotted a budget for your group in 2019. Please encourage your attendees to use Meetup, because this is what we use to calculate budgets each year. 

We have allotted funds to reimburse your group for food and drinks. Your budget for the year is: {{ yearlyBudget }}. This translates to roughly {{ monthlyBudget }} per month.

In order to arrange your reimbursement, please provide the following:

- A picture of the receipt
- A photo of the meetup in action (posted to the Meetup event)

Once those have been provided via the event's Github issue, you can apply for reimbursement through Venmo. If you are unfamiliar with Venmo, please [check out our instructions](https://github.com/techlahoma/user-group-docs/blob/master/Requesting-Reimbursement.md).

We are very excited to be working with you this year and beyond! If you have any questions, please contact the usergroup committee in `#usergroup-organizers` on Slack.

Thank you for the work you do in the community, and welcome to Techlahoma!

Sincerely,

Techlahoma User Group Committee
