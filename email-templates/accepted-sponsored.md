Dear { usergroup_name },

We are pleased to inform you that the Techlahoma Board approved { usergroup_name } for { year }.

Your group is important to the Oklahoma tech community, and Techlahoma is excited to sponsor your group! Please note that we use [Meetup](link) for events. Meetup allows us to carefully track the number of Oklahomans each of the groups reaches, which in turn helps us know where to focus our efforts.

{ if approved for SS46 }

Additionally, we are pleased to offer space for your group to meet at [StarSpace46](link) at { dateAndTime }. Your event space reservation cannot be completed until your event is scheduled on Meetup, so _please schedule your events promptly._

{ if approved for food/drink reimbursement }

We know it's easier to provide the content your group provides when you don't have to worry about food and drinks. We have allotted funds to reimburse your group for food, up to $4 per attendee.

In order to arrange your reimbursement, please provide the following:

- A picture of the receipt
- A final headcount for the event (including organizers)
- A photo of the meetup in action

Once those have been provided via the event's Github issue, you can apply for reimbursement through [cash.me](link). If you do not have a Square Cash account, [please go ahead and create one](link to instructions).

We are very excited to be working with you in { year } and beyond! If you have any questions, please contact { outreach_person } at { outreach_contact }.

Thank you for the work you do in the community, and welcome to Techlahoma!

Sincerely,

{ usergroup_commitee }
