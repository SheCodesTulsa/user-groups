Dear { usergroup_name },

We are pleased to inform you that the Techlahoma Board approved { usergroup_name } for 2019.

Your group is important to the Oklahoma tech community, and Techlahoma is excited to partner with you! Please note that we use [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) for events. Meetup allows us to carefully track the number of Oklahomans each of the groups reaches, which in turn helps us know where to focus our efforts. 

### Meetup

- Avoid recurring events
  We have automation in place that schedules tweets and opens issues, and recurring events don't play nicely with our automation.

- Schedule meetups at least 7 days in advance
  It's best to make sure meetings are schedule in advance to make sure your attendees are aware of the meeting, as well as making sure space is available.

If you are unfamiliar with Meetup, please [check out our Meetup how-to guide](https://github.com/techlahoma/user-group-docs/blob/master/Meetup-Events.md).

Thank you for the work you do in the community, and welcome to Techlahoma!

Sincerely,

Techlahoma User Group Committee
