Dear { usergroup_name },

We are pleased to inform you that the Techlahoma Board approved { usergroup_name } for { year }.

Your group is important to the Oklahoma tech community, and Techlahoma is excited to partner with you! Please note that we use [Meetup](link) for events. Meetup allows us to carefully track the number of Oklahomans each of groups reaches, which in turn helps us know where to focus our efforts. 

If you have any questions about how to set up or use Meetup, please contact { outreach_person } at { outreach_contact }.

Thank you for the work you do in the community, and welcome to Techlahoma!

Sincerely,

{ usergroup_commitee }
