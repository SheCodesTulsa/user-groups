Dear { usergroup_name },

We are pleased to inform you that the Techlahoma Board approved { usergroup_name } for conditional sponsorship in { year }.

The board will approve your { affilatedOrSponsored } group, per the following conditions:

{ requirements }

If you have any questions about the previous requirements, please reach out to usergroups@techlahoma.org.

Please note that we use [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) for events. Meetup allows us to carefully track the number of Oklahomans each of the groups reaches, which in turn helps us know where to focus our efforts.

### Meetup

We have a few requirements for your meetup.

- Avoid recurring events  
  We have automation in place that schedules tweets and opens issues, and recurring events don't play nicely with our automation.

- Schedule all meetings at least 7 days in advance
  Please make sure the event is created on meetup at least 7 days in advance. There are a few reasons for this, including our automation and generally making sure space is available. It's also nice for your attendees to be able to know when and where the next meeting will be with enough planning time. Meetup automatically announces your meeting 7 days before it occurs to your members as well.

- Coordinate any streaming with the broadcasting committee
  If you would like your meetup to be streamed, please contact the broadcasting committee to coordinate. You can ask questions in the #ss46-ug-leaders channel in Slack. (If you are not in this channel, you can request access from the usergroup committee.)

*Please note that if your meeting is not scheduled on Meetup at least 7 days in advance, **you will not be able to meet at StarSpace46.***

{ if approved for SS46 }

### StarSpace46

If your group plans to meet at StarSpace46:

- At least two co-organizers must sign and return the [StarSpace46 User Group Leader agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q1m6q4v3VrS6yVuP-tVImkNZZXG0pq_uktydbfWiovM/edit) to Ava **by 2/1.**
  You may sign the agreement and send Ava a picture of the signed agreement in Slack or give it to her directly when you are at StarSpace46.

- Meetups must be scheduled at least one week in advance  
  StarSpace46 requires at least 7 days notice in order to use the event space. If your meetup is not scheduled at least one week in advance, StarSpace46 will not be available.

*Please note that this agreement needs to signed again each year.*

{ if Tulsa }

### Tulsa

In Tulsa, we are happy to help you find space for your meetups.

If you’re meetup overlaps with the entrepreneurship community, you may find 36°N to be a good venue partner. We can introduce you to their venue coordinator and help you fill out [their event rental application](https://www.36degreesnorth.co/eventrental).

We have also partnered with Tulsa Library on a number of Techlahoma events. Their [meeting rooms are free to book with your library card](https://www.tulsalibrary.org/using-the-library/meeting-rooms), and we can introduce you to Central Library’s Digital Literacy Lab coordinator to help arrange your events.

Please contact Luke Crouch (@groovecoder in Slack) for more information.

{ if approved for food/drink reimbursement }

### Food and Drink Reimbursement

We know it's easier to keeping providing content for your group when you don't have to worry about food and drinks, so we've allotted a budget for your group in 2019. Please encourage your attendees to use Meetup, because this is what we use to calculate budgets each year. 

We have allotted funds to reimburse your group for food and drinks. Your budget for the year is: {{ yearlyBudget }}. This translates to roughly {{ monthlyBudget }} per month.

In order to arrange your reimbursement, please provide the following:

- A picture of the receipt
- A photo of the meetup in action (posted to the Meetup event)

Once those have been provided via the event's GitHub issue, you can apply for reimbursement through Venmo. If you are unfamiliar with Venmo, please [check out our instructions](https://github.com/techlahoma/user-group-docs/blob/master/Requesting-Reimbursement.md).

We are very excited to be working with you this year and beyond! If you have any questions, please contact the usergroup committee in `#usergroup-organizers` on Slack.

Thank you for the work you do in the community, and welcome to Techlahoma!

Sincerely,

Techlahoma User Group Committee
