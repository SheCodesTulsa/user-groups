# Techlahoma User Group Speakers & Topics

When a user group organizer is recruiting for a meetup presentation,
they can use this file to see speakers who have ready-made presentations,
so they can more quickly and easily find a presenter.

Please add your own topics and a speaker bio in the sections below.

To prevent you from getting speaking requests for old/stale presentations,
please only add topics that are either timeless (e.g., algorithms),
or topics for which you intend to keep up-to-date slide decks.

## Topics, Speaker

* Productive Programmer, Luke Crouch
  * An overview of [The Productive Programmer book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596519544.do) by Neal Ford
* Scary JavaScript (and other tech) that tracks you online, Luke Crouch
  * There are over 5,000 online trackers that use cookies, fingerprinting, and probablistic device matching to follow you across the web. Some methods are actively used for fraud, malware, and intrusive user tracking. Some are commonly used for legit purposes. We'll talk about how sites are able to follow users, tracking methods both fair and foul, and how users & developers can protect themselves from tracking.
* Crypto: 500 BC - Present, Luke Crouch
  * A 60-minute overview of The Code Book by Simon Singh, covering secrecy from ancient Greece to quantum cryptography. This is a cursory, high-level, mostly-non-mathematical survey of centuries of crypto - good as an intro to crypto for developers and non-devs alike.
* An Introduction to Microcontrollers, Jonathan Bartlett
  * An introduction to the world of microcontrollers, what they do, and why we should care, focusing on the world of Arduino.  This is for groups who are generally unfamiliar with the embedded world and want to know more.  Flexible time, and can do versions of this talk that include more or less technical information about programming microcontrollers and/or the basics of electronics.
* Building Scalable Web Applications Using the Cloud, Jonathan Bartlett
  * A talk on the basics of making web architectures for scalability, including load balancers, caching, database replication, and programming in these environments.  Focused on developers who can build web applications but have kept to single-machine implementations.  Uses PHP, PostgreSQL, Linode, and AWS for its examples.  Based on a book by the same name. 
* Getting the Most Out of PostgreSQL, Jonathan Bartlett
  * Many people only know a fraction of what the databases they use on a daily basis can do.  This topic covers a variety of lesser-known topics in PostgreSQL including replication, full-text searching, fuzzy searching, tuning, strange indexes, and strange column types.
* Computer Science and its Interrelationship with Philosophy and Theology, Jonathan Bartlett
  * Most people don't realize that the concept of computing was built to solve philosophical questions rather than business issues.  This talk follows the work of GÃ¶del, Turing, Chaitin, and others who have continued the conversation regarding the philosophical and theological insights that computer science has to offer.
