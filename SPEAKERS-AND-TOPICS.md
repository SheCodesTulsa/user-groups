# Techlahoma User Group Speakers & Topics

When a user group organizer is recruiting for a meetup presentation,
they can use this file to see speakers who have ready-made presentations,
so they can more quickly and easily find a presenter.

Please add your own topics and a speaker bio in the sections below.

To prevent you from getting speaking requests for old/stale presentations,
please only add topics that are either timeless (e.g., algorithms),
or topics for which you intend to keep up-to-date slide decks.

## Topics, Speaker

* Productive Programmer, Luke Crouch
  * An overview of [The Productive Programmer book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596519544.do) by Neal Ford
* Scary JavaScript (and other tech) that tracks you online, Luke Crouch
  * There are over 5,000 online trackers that use cookies, fingerprinting, and probablistic device matching to follow you across the web. Some methods are actively used for fraud, malware, and intrusive user tracking. Some are commonly used for legit purposes. We'll talk about how sites are able to follow users, tracking methods both fair and foul, and how users & developers can protect themselves from tracking.
* Crypto: 500 BC - Present, Luke Crouch
  * A 60-minute overview of The Code Book by Simon Singh, covering secrecy from ancient Greece to quantum cryptography. This is a cursory, high-level, mostly-non-mathematical survey of centuries of crypto - good as an intro to crypto for developers and non-devs alike.
